# Assignment 3 - Functions and Modules in Python

This assignment demonstrates the use of user-defined functions and Python's built-in `math` module.

---

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**File:** `Task_1.py`

- Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
- Takes user input for the number.
- Handles invalid input (e.g., negative numbers).
- Prints the factorial result.

**Example Usage:**
```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**File:** `Task_2.py`

- Demonstrates the use of Python's `math` module.
- Performs various mathematical calculations such as:
  - Square root
  - Power
  - Sine, cosine, and tangent
  - Logarithm
- Takes user input where required and displays results.

**Example Usage:**
```
Enter a number to find its square root: 16
Square root of 16 is 4.0

Enter base: 2
Enter exponent: 3
2 raised to the power 3 is 8

Sine of 90 degrees is 1.0
Cosine of 0 degrees is 1.0
Tangent of 45 degrees is 1.0

Enter a number to find its natural logarithm: 10
Natural logarithm of 10 is 2.302585092994046
```
