# Assignment 1 - Basic Python Concepts

This assignment contains two Python programs demonstrating basic input/output and arithmetic operations.

## Task 1: Basic Calculator

[Task 1.py](Task%201.py) implements a simple calculator that:

1. Takes two numbers as input from the user
2. Performs basic arithmetic operations:
   - Addition 
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication 
   - Division
3. Displays the results of each operation

### Example Usage:
```python
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0
```

## Task 2: Name Greeter

[Task 2.py](Task%202.py) is a greeting program that:

1. Asks user for their first name
2. Asks user for their last name
3. Adds an exclamation mark to the last name
4. Prints a welcome message with the formatted name

### Example Usage:
```python
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```

Both programs demonstrate fundamental Python concepts including:
- User input handling
- String manipulation
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Print formatting
