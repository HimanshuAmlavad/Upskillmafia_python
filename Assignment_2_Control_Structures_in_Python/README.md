# Assignment 2 - Control Structures in Python

This assignment contains two Python programs demonstrating the use of control structures including conditionals and loops.

## Task 1: Even/Odd Number Checker

[Task_1.py](Task_1.py) implements a program that:

1. Takes a number as input from the user
2. Determines if the number is even or odd using conditional statements
3. Displays the result

### Example Usage:
```python
Enter a Number: 7
7 is an odd number

Enter a Number: 12
12 is an Even number
```

## Task 2: Number Series Sum Calculator

[Task_2.py](Task_2.py) is a program that:

1. Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50
2. Calculates the sum of all numbers in this range
3. Prints the final sum

### Example Usage:
```python
The sum of number from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```

Both programs demonstrate Python control structures including:
- If-else conditionals
- For loops
- Range function
- Arithmetic operations
- Print formatting
